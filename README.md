# friendly-parakeet

One time, I bought a parakeet training record at a used record shop,
even though I didn't have a parakeet.  If I did ever get one, I would
be equipped.

That doesn't have much to do with this library.  This is just a very
simple starter for a javascript app using webpack and babel, so I
don't have to write this part every time.

## Installation
1. Clone this repo and rename it to whatever you want.
